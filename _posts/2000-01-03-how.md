# Pioneer **AI-powered solutions** for core **human observation** problems

Currently, Computer Vision challenges are best tackled employing heavily trained Neural Network architectures. Despite the advancement of the field and the emergence of "best practices", it still takes experts to convert basic research into novel and effective solutions that work "in the wild", and not just in the lab.

_We are Computer Vision experts_.

# Develop **integrated applications** to solve **real world problems**

An AI architecture rarely deals with a real world problem in its entirety. It's not just the basic stuff, like data marshalling and visualization that's involved. It's also all the mechanisms that need to be put into place to provide guarantees (uptime, robustness, throughput, scalability) and overall end-to-end operability.

_Training networks is only a part of what we do_.
